    "Write a function `genwaveform(N=100, α=0.1, A=1, σ=1)` to generate a waveform that is a linear combination of a sparsely occuring signal and additive Gaussian noise. The parameters specify the waveform length `N`, the signal  probability `α`, the signal amplitude `A`, and noise standard deviation $\\sigma$.  Assume the noise mean is zero.  The values listed are defaults.  The signal probability specifies the probability of an event occurring within a sample.  Assume the events are independent.  The function should return a tuple of the resulting waveform and array of the event locations as indices.\n",

Note that \"signal\" is sometimes used loosely to refer to the observed waveform, rather than the waveform without the noise.  This is because the signal itself cannot be observed directly, only inferred.  The term \"underlying signal\" is often used to emphasize the component of the waveform without the noise.)"

    "\n",
    "In the last assignment you used the Fourier transform to form a represenatation of signals in terms of frequencies.  Here we will construct the discrete Fourier transform from the mathematics as an exercise in basis representation and to see how it relates to a matrix-vector operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) decomposes a signal of length $N$ into a set of $N$ frequencies.  We will now see how these form a **basis** and provide an equivalent (i.e. invertible) representation of arbitrary signals of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors than **span** the space, i.e. it is possible to represent all signals of length $N$.  If the vectors are also mutually orthogonal with unit norm, this is called an **orthonormal basis**, which is the case for most common transforms.  In linear algebra terms, this is equivalent to defining different axes for the same data.  Here, we are going from the axes of sample values to axes of frequency components.\n",

    "Note here we are using the complex exponential representation discussed in A4.The basis functions must satisfy certain conditions in order to form a proper basis.  Each frequency contains a whole number of periods over $N$ samples, so it is a periodic function, i.e. $w_k[0] = w_k[N]$ = 1.  \n"

For the lowest frequency $k=1/N$, the values for $n=0, \\ldots, N-1$ simply trace out the discrete cosine and sine functions, each completing a full period in $N$ samples. For $k=2/N$, it is the same process except in steps of $2\\pi \\cdot 2/N$, so two full periods are completed for $N$ samples. "

Your examples should resemble figures 4.2 to 4.5 in the Prandoni and Vetterli reference.

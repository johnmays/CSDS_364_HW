    "### Setting up your Jupyter Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will be completing your assignments primarily in a jupyter notebook, which provides an interactive development environment that allows you to write code, equations, visualizations, and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You first task is to setup a jupyter notebook environment on your system.  As a default starting point, I would recommend installing anaconda ([the individual edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)) and then jupyterlab (see [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous other installation possibilities, but all you need is to be able to create jupyter notebooks and write code in either python or julia.  The advantage of anaconda is that installs a standard python environment with numerous packages like numpy, scikit, etc.  If you use julia (which is what I use), you will need to install the [latest julia distribution](https://julialang.org) and the [IJulia package](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).  It is also possible to use Matlab, which has it's own notebook environment, but you should instead install the matlab kernel in jupyterlab (google \"jupyterlab matlab kernel\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are most suitable for the exploration and development of short functions.  When your programs become more complex or more difficult to debug, it is usually more efficient to write and debug your code in a traditional IDE like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we do not recommend a specific plotting library, as there are numerous choices, and which one you prefer depends on factors like what you are already familiar with, what you're interested in learning, or the functionality you need.  For python, a common choice is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).  In julia, the [Plots.jl package](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) provides a standard interface to several different backends.  You should feel free to explore others."
